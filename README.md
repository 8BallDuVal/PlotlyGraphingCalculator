# PlotlyGraphingCalculator
Graph functions, take integrals/derivatives of those functions, and plot them on the same graph.

Written in Python 3.6.5 for Windows. Uses the Plotly API to create interactive graphs that open in a web browser.

The program was written using Object-Oriented Programming, and requires that you initialize a Calculus object with a function string.

Here's a quick example of initializing a Calculus object:

    function = Calculus('3*x**3-4')

The function variable is now considered a Calculus object, and you can use the program's methods to take derivatives, integrate, or plot the function.

Here is a list of the included methods:
- __init__ --> initializes the object with specific properties.
- __repr__ --> returns an easily readible representation of the object when you print an object variable to the console.
- __str__ --> similar to __repr__, this method simply returns the function of the object.
- __add__ --> allows you to 'add' together two object variable's functions in a string.
- take_derivative --> takes the derivative of a function, and returns the derivative.
- take_integral --> takes the integral of a function, and returns the integral.
- set_domain --> allows you to manually set the domain of a function.
- set_range --> after setting the domain, the range must be set using the domain values.
- plot_points --> using the domain and range values, plot the points on an interactive graph (generated by the Plotly API)
- plot_derivative --> Plots the derivative function and original function on the same graph


This is still a work in progress. Let me know if you have any questions/conerns!
